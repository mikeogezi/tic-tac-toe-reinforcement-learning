# Tic-Tac-Toe Reinforcement Learning
This project explores how an ML agent trained through reinforcement learning learns how to play Tic-Tac-Toe

## Required dependencies
+ OpenAI Gym
+ Keras
+ Keras-RL
+ Numpy
+ Pandas

To install the dependencies run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage 
+ To train the model, run `python train_model.py`
+ To play against the pretrained model, run `python play_with_model.py`

A jupyter notebook outlining the processes that I took can be found [here](./tac_tac_toe.ipynb)
